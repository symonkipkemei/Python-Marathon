A shift code is where a message can be easily encoded and is one of the simplest codes to
use. Each letter is moved forwards through the alphabet a set number of letters to be
represented by a new letter. For instance, “abc” becomes “bcd” when the code is shifted by
one (i.e. each letter in the alphabet is moved forward one character).

If the user selects 1, they should be able to type in a message (including spaces) and then
enter a number. Python should then display the encoded message once the shift code has
been applied.

If the user selects 2, they should enter an encoded message and the
correct number and it should display the decoded message (i.e.
move the correct number of letters backwards through the
alphabet).
If they select 3 it should stop the program from running.
After they have encoded or decoded a message the menu should be
displayed to them again until they select quit.
