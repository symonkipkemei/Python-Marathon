# BEGINNER LEVEL WITH PYTHON BY EXAMPLE NICOLA LACEY
Here is my journey through PYTHON BY EXAMPLE :learning to programme in 150 challenges by Nicola Lacey.
I have attempted these challenges three times.The first time.I got distracted by life along the way.
The second time I reached the end of part 1 and took a break to explore the ideas in my head.
The third time I made a thunderbolt move starting from basics all the way to chunky challenges.
